# Garage Parking Sensor

This package consists code to develop low cost garage parking sensor that can be just placed on the hood or even screwed to the wall. The system measures the distance between bumper and wall, displays 0-9 inches on a 7 segment display and provides acoustic feedback if equipped.

## Hardwares
* Arduino Uno/Nano.
* 7 Segment display.
* Ultrasonic sensor.
* Buzzer (optional).
* Colourful LEDs (optional, for more visual feeback).
* Wires.
* USB plug or DC pins or any other connectors for powering up.
* Gangbox for housing the components.
* Magnets to prevent the box from falling off while the car moves. If opting to make it portable.

## Instructions

- Clone this repository and flash the program onto the Arduino.
- Drill holes in the gang box and install sensor as well as display at the desired position.
- Connect hardwares as shown in the diagram and powerup the Arduino.
- Place the box on the hood or fix it on the wall in such a way that, the digit is visible while driving and sensor measures the distance between wall and the bumper.
